# Java Service-Oriented Systems Project - Wine Community Management

## Overview

This project is a Java-based service-oriented system designed to manage a wine community. The application provides functionalities to handle user interactions, manage community-related information, and streamline communication within a wine enthusiast community. This project serves as a foundational system for service-oriented architecture using Java, showcasing key principles of modularity and interaction between services.

## Features

- **User Interaction Management**: Handles user interactions, account management, and community contributions.
- **Community Data Management**: Manages data specific to the wine community, including user preferences, wine types, and community discussions.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Demonstrates the principles of SOA with modular services and interactions.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Custom error handling to ensure smooth user experience and effective debugging.

## Project Structure

The main components of the application are organized as follows:

- `ClientePrueba.class` - Sample client for testing service interactions within the system.
- Additional components for handling various aspects of community management, each organized by function.

## File Naming Conventions

Configuration files, if any, should use the `.yaml` or `.yml` extension for consistency and compatibility in service configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
Compile the project: Ensure that you have Java installed, then run:

bash

javac -d bin src/**/*.java
Run the application: Navigate to the bin folder and execute:

bash

java MainClassName

## Technologies Used
- Java: Core programming language for the project, showcasing object-oriented principles and service-oriented design.

- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): Modular service-based approach for managing different community aspects.
